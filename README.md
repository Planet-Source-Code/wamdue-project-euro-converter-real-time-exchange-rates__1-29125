### Description

This is a follow up to the code posted yesterday about a Euro converter. The problem with all converters I have seen on here is that the exchange rate is hard coded in to the program. This one is different however. It grabs the latest exchange rates from a web site and uses them! Very simple app, but could be made to convert between any currency and another very easily. VOTE UK INDEPENDENCE PARTY! :o)
